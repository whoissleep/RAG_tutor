Generally, KAT outperforms both the ViT and DeiT models. ViT+KAN performs poorly on ImageNet-level training. Abstract Transformers stand as the cornerstone of mordern deep learning. Traditionally, these models rely on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers to mix the information between channels. In this paper, we introduce the Kolmogorov–Arnold Transformer (KAT), a novel architecture that replaces MLP layers with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers to enhance the expressiveness and performance of the model. Integrating KANs into transformers, however, is no easy feat, especially when scaled up. Specifically, we identify three key challenges: (C1) Base function. The standard B-spline function used in KANs is not optimized for parallel computing on modern hardware, resulting in slower inference speeds. (C2) Parameter and Computation Inefficiency. KAN requires a unique function for each input-output pair, making the computation extremely large. (C3) Weight initialization. The initialization of weights in KANs is particularly challenging due to their learnable activation functions, which are critical for achieving convergence in deep neural networks. To overcome the aforementioned challenges, we propose three key solutions: (S1) Rational basis. We replace B-spline functions with rational functions to improve compatibility with modern GPUs. By implementing this in CUDA, we achieve faster computations. (S2) Group KAN. We share the activation weights through a group of neurons, to reduce the computational load without sacrificing performance. (S3) Variance-preserving initialization. We carefully initialize the activation weights to make sure that the activation variance is maintained across layers. With these designs, KAT scales effectively and readily outperforms traditional MLP-based transformers. We demonstrate the advantages of KAT across various tasks, including image recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation. It consistently enhances performance over the standard transformer architectures of different model sizes. Our code is openly available at https://github.com/Adamdad/kat. 1 Introduction Transformers have become the de facto architecture in deep learning, widely adopted in computer vision [DBK+21] and natural language processing [VSP+17]. At their core, transformers are built upon two fundamental components: attention 1 arXiv:2409.10594v1  [cs.LG]  16 Sep 2024'},\n {'page_number': 2,\n  'page_char_counts': 4781,\n  'page_word_counts': 652,\n  'page_sents_counts': 50,\n  'page_token_counts(approximately)': 1195.25,\n  'text': 'modules and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). Although significant research has focused on replacing the traditional attention mechanism with alternative operations [LLC+21, LMW+22, THK+21], these variants still lean heavily on MLPs. Surprisingly, there have been relatively few efforts [Sha20] aimed at enhancing MLPs themselves. Opening up the box, MLPs are composed of stacked linear layers coupled with non-linear activations. What makes it so popular is that, theoretically, they can approximate any function, assuming that there are enough neurons avail- able [HSW89]. However, despite their versatility, MLPs face limitations in modeling complex functions. For example, when using ReLU-like activation, a two-layer MLP may struggle to fit periodic functions. Moreover, employing gradient descent to train these networks often results in prolonged convergence times for high-frequency components [RBA+19, BGG+20, RJKK19]. These challenges have led researchers to explore alternative, perhaps more expressive architectures than MLPs. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) emerged as a powerful alternative. KANs are noted for their theoretical parameter efficiency, potentially requiring fewer parameters to model complex functions [LWV+24]. They are particularly suitable for mathematical or symbolic regression tasks [YYW24, BC24a, LMW+24]. The key to such success is the learnable base function in each input-output pair. Those functions are often parameterized by B-spline curves [UAE93, GR74]. This design allows KANs to approximate more intricate functions through a summation of spline bases. Given its potential, integrating KAN layers into transformers [VSP+17] becomes an exciting topic. Such integration may boost the expressiveness and efficiency of transformers, enhancing their competitiveness across a wide range of applications. Unfortunately, this ambition has been met with limited success. In particular, KANs have been reported to be “10× slower than MLPs, given the same number of parameters”. Initial attempts to apply KANs to vision recognition tasks have yielded disappointing results. Even on a small scale, these studies have consistently fallen short of matching, let alone surpassing, the performance of traditional architectures. This lack of improvement is often attributed to the limited computational resources and ongoing scalability problems [Che24a, BTSP24, Che24a, Che24b]. In a preliminary experiment, we attempted to replace MLP layers in the Vision Transformer (ViT) with KAN layers. It creates a model, which we call ViT+KAN. However, as shown in Figure 1 (Right), this straightforward substitution led to significant challenges when performing ImageNet-scale training, resulting in poor performance. Scalability, therefore, remains a significant obstacle for KAN-based models. Motivation and Challenges. Through dedicated analysis, we have identified several key challenges that hinder the effectiveness of KANs in large-scale applications, ultimately limiting their scalability. • (C1) Base function. The standard B-spline functions in KANs are not ideal for parallel computing architectures typical of modern GPUs. B-splines require recursive computation, which significantly slows down even the most optimized implementations. • (C2) Parameter and Computation Inefficiency. Each unique input-output pair in a KAN requires a distinct set of parameters and base functions. This necessity causes an exponential growth in the number of parameters as the network’s hidden size increases, resulting in substantial computational overhead and scalability issues. • (C3) Weight initialization. The weight initialization in KANs is similar to that in MLPs, but it does not meet KANs’ needs for convergence. This mismatch can lead to instability and degraded performance during the training process. Our Approach. In this paper, we introduce Kolmogorov–Arnold Transformer (KAT), which successfully integrates KANs into transformers for large-scale training scenarios such as ImageNet. Beyond simple replacement, We have developed three key innovations (S1-S3) to address these challenges (C1-C3) respectively. • (S1) Rational activation. We employ rational function as our base function and provide full CUDA implementation. It aligns better with modern GPU architectures, enhancing computational efficiency and compatibility. • (S2) Group KAN. We share function coefficients and base functions among groups of edges. This strategy reduces computational load significantly without sacrificing performance. • (S3) Variance-preserving initialization. We carefully initialize weights to maintain consistent variance in activations across the model’s layers. This ensures stability during training and improves the model’s learning dynamics. 2'}]"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Круто, теперь у нас есть словарь, в котором много информации о тексте.

Our proposed Group-Rational KAN (GR-KAN) variant, with its rational activation functions, group-based parameter sharing, and variance-preserving initialization, demonstrated significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability. Through extensive experiments on vision tasks, including image recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation, KAT outperformed traditional MLP-based transformers, achieving superior accuracy on ImageNet1K while maintaining comparable computational demands. Discussion. Our study highlights KAT’s potential as a good alternative to MLP-based transformers, especially in large-scale vision tasks. This integration introduces exciting opportunities for broad applications. For example, employing KAT architectures might help development of language models. However, KAT is not without its challenges. A primary concern is running speed. Even with the CUDA optimized code, the rational function is still slower than plain activation like ReLU and GELU. Another issue is the stability when using rational functions in neural networks. The higher order gradients for 𝑎𝑚and 𝑏𝑛can become unstable because of their dependence on the input power. Integrating these functions into the backpropagation process could introduce complications. Additionally, it is important to acknowledge that our GR-KAN represents a hybrid model. On the one hand, GR-KAN is a KAN layer with shared edges and a rational base function. On the other hand, it can be interpret as MLP with a redesigned activation placed before the linear layer. It leverages the computational simplicity of MLPs but maintains some characteristics of KANs. However, GR-KAN is not a pure KAN model. Instead, it merges advantages from both systems to enhance overall functionality. Future Work. There are multiple directions of KAT for future research. One potential area of exploration is to find alter- native base functions to further improve computational efficiency and compatibility with emerging hardware architectures. Currently, rational functions serve as one option, but other possibilities exist. These include Fourier transformations [Noe24], Wavelet transforms [BC24b], and Gaussian radial bases [Li24]. Additionally, expanding the applicability of KAT to other domains beyond vision tasks, such as natural language processing or reinforcement learning, could unlock new opportunities for performance gains. Further research could also investigate hybrid models [YZL+22, YSZ+23], or adaptive mechanisms for dynamically selecting between KAN and MLP layers based on the complexity of the task, thereby optimizing resource utilization. Finally, addressing the remaining scalability challenges, particularly in terms of memory footprint and inference speed, will be crucial for deploying KAT in real-world applications at scale.
